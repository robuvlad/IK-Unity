# _Virtual Parallel robots. Forward and Inverse Kinematics_

- The main topic of this project outlines the development of two parallel robots in a virtual environment: the Gough-Stewart platform and the Delta Robot.
- An important branch of the vast field of robotics is the analysis of the parallel robots from a kinematic point of view. 
- The focus is on the structure and representation of the robots mentioned above, their forward and inverse kinematics, and, last but not least, on the integration of kinematic algorithms in real-world uses through various virtual simulations.

### Tech

- Unity: used for virtual simulations
- Blender: used for 3D modeling of robots
- C#
- Math.NET Numerics Framework
